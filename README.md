# GITHUB API TEST
Testing the github api with node.js and angular

You can research github repos and show some details .

## Getting started

Basically , to use this web app , you have just to download or clone this repository , install the needed packages and run the app.

### Prerequisites

To install all packages , do the following commands in the project root folder
```
> npm install
```

To run the app ,just run de server  by following this instruction

```
> node server.js
```

## Used languages  

This web application is developed with node.js and angular only, with the followings frameworks :

* Bootstrap V4
* Express
* Request
* Googleapis Materials icons


## V1

Actually I choose to divide the home page of the application in 2 panel, first one to list all the searched repositories and the second to show the details of a repository. But isn't useful for a good UX.

Next update will change the main structure to show the details in pop-up like div.


Not  responsive on mobile yet, only on desktop, a personal choice to manage my time and dev the features first. However, I will include a responsive version after.
